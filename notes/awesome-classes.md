 -> Make guesses to commit and learn from your mistakes [link](https://youtu.be/SXHHvoaSctc?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ&t=205)
 -> He is using props and drawings a lot, as well as jokes

 -> "Who is not convinced? ... Almost half the class should not be convinced. You are all convinced? You are a bunch of geniuses" [link](https://youtu.be/SXHHvoaSctc?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ&t=1467) -> makes students feel good + think about the question + reassure that its normal not to be convinced / understand
 -> Break of 5 minutes every half hour

 -> Make remarks about interesting and advanced stuff, connecting to other fields, even if students will likely not understand everything (or even anything) It still makes wonder and you see the big scope of the implications of what you are learning.
